### 젊은 임상약리학자 세션 (Young clinical pharmacologists session)

'Metaanalysis and systematic review'에서는 Matthieu Roustit (University Grenoble Alpes, France), Joaquín Sáez-Peñataro (Hospital Clínic Barcelona, Spain) 두 임상약리학자 간의 메타분석과 체계적 고찰에 대한 토론이 있었다. 메타분석이 없이는 체계적 분석이 이뤄질 수 없다는 큰 원칙 하에 높은 수준의 의학 정보를 생산해내기 위한 최선의 방법론을 참석자들과 공유하였다. 두가지 연구 방법의 우열을 가릴 수 없으며 가능한 자원을 최대한 활용할 수 있는 연구 방법을 택해야 한다는 결론을 내릴 수 있었다.

이후 본 저자를 포함한 총 네 명의 임상약리학자들이 구연발표를 진행하였다. 첫번째 연자인 Emmanouela Kampouraki (뉴캐슬 대학교, 영국)는 CYP4F2 유전형이 만성 와파린 치료를 받는 소아에서 순환 혈장 비타민 K의 농도에 영향을 준다는 연구 결과를 발표하였다.

### PLENARY SESSION: "Adverse drug reactions – state of the art in 2017"

EMA (European Medicines Agency)의 June Raine이 "약물이상반응 - 2017년의 최신지견"이라는 제목의 plenary session을 열었다.
유럽에서는 'PRIME', FDA에서는 'Breakthrough Therapy'를 획득하여 빠른 개발의 필요성이 인정받는 경우를 말한다. 이 경우에는 더더욱 이상반응(adverse events)을 빠르게 발견, 평가 및 이해가 필요하다.

약물의 빠른 개발과정에서 이상반응의 감시 뿐만 아니라 약물 시판 후의 안전성을 감시하는 Pharmacovigilance의 중요성도 갈수록 커지고 있다.

> ADR (Adverse Drug Reactions)에 대한 현재의 이해, 그리고 앞으로의 연구방향에 대해 진단하였습니다. Pharmacovigilance의 중요성. ADR의 연구와 활용에 많은 도전과 어려운 점이 있습니다.

- 'Detection, assessment, understanding and prevention of adverse effects or related problems'
- signal detection, better characterised risks, ongoing evaluation, risk minimization, monitor risk minimization effectiveness
- Evolution of PV -> 1980년대에은 자발적인 케이스 리포트 -> 2. 역학 데이타 3. proactive risk 4. continuous risk monitor
- 약물 허가 시점에 우리는 ADR에 대해 많이 알고 있지 못할 것.
- Landmark - Thalidomide, Practolol, 2000 - Cerivastatin, HRT, SSRI, coxib, rosiglitazone, gadolinium CA 급격히 많아지는 시점이 2000년대임. - 임상약리학의 역할이 컸을 것이다.
- EMA의 PV risk assessment committee가 조성되어 PV에 대해 많은 국가들이 협력적인 관계를 맺고 있다.
- meeting highlights (PRAC) 새로운 약물의 PV에 대해 모여서 회의하게 된다.
- Spontaneous ADR report - "Signal"
- increasing volume으로 인하여 이것을 일일이 확인하기란 참 어려움.
- HPV vaccine - risk of fatigue syndrome - no increase in CFS observed vs expected rates using max sequential | 사실상 큰 차이 없음.
- PV activity: signal detection and invetigation

- SGLT2 inhibitors & DKA: type 2 DM, 
- fluoroquinolones - risk characterization - already characterized. nothing new. but full characterization은 여전히 진행 중.
- benefit risk evaluation - Gad and tissue accumulation: nephrogenic system fibrosis
- Risk minimization effectiveness - valproate - developmental disorders - increased autistic spectrum disease 
- valproate의 사용이 유럽의 여러 국가마다 크게 다른데 왜 그러한지? 프랑스에서는 bipolar에 60%가 처방하는데 그렇지 않은 경우가 많다.
- Challenges - biological medicines, earlier access to new med and vaccines
- 1. biological medicines Rebif - increaingly unwell -> htn, arf - thbombocytopenic - TMA (thrombotic microangiopathy) -> small vessel damage (2016)
	- BMJ - Evolution of biological safety
- 2. Access to innovative med
	- Pembrolizumab - safety specification, PV plan, Risk minimization
- Opportunities for PV - collaborative education & training, digital transformation, social media(new data source)
- ADR reporting communication materials
- IMI WEB-RADR mobile app - anyone can report
- QR codes
- patterns of abuse - twitter
- systems biology approaches - genome, microbiome, metabolome, nutrition, lifestyle - integration

BackgroundGo
The tyrosine kinase inhibitor erlotinib displays large inter-individual variability in plasma PK. Erlotinib undergoes hepatobiliary clearance and is a substrate and/or inhibitor of different hepatic ABC and SLC transporters (P-gp, BCRP, OATPs). In this PET study we assessed hepatic disposition of 11C-erlotinib both at micro- and therapeutic doses to investigate the involvement of carrier-mediated processes in the hepatic clearance of erlotinib.

MethodsGo
Six healthy volunteers (mean age: 27 ± 6 years) underwent two consecutive abdominal [11C]erlotinib PET scans and arterial blood sampling. The first scan was performed after administration of a microdose of 11C-erlotinib (<20 µg). In the second scan a microdose of 11C-erlotinib was administered at 3 hours after oral treatment with a therapeutic erlotinib dose (300 mg). Radiolabelled metabolites of 11C-erlotinib in plasma were assessed with a solid-phase extraction protocol. PET and blood data were analysed with compartment modelling.

ResultsGo
During the PET scans only a low amount (<5%) of radiolabelled metabolites of [11C]erlotinib was detected in plasma both for the micro- and therapeutic dose scans. As compared with the microdose scan, AUC values of concentration-time curves of 11C-erlotinib in plasma were significantly increased in the therapeutic dose scan by 99 ± 27%, whereas AUC values in the liver and liver-to-plasma AUC ratios were decreased by 55 ± 5% and 77 ± 5%, respectively. For the therapeutic dose a significant decrease (-39 ± 18%) in the influx rate constant of 11C-erlotinib from blood into hepatocytes was found, whereas the efflux rate constant from hepatocytes into gall bladder and bile duct remained unchanged.

ConclusionsGo
Our data show that liver uptake of a microdose of [11C]erlotinib occurred via a carrier-mediated process, which became inhibited at therapeutic erlotinib doses. Active uptake transport of erlotinib into the liver may account for variability in plasma PK and potentially play a role in transporter-mediated drug interactions.

### Characterization of absorption, metabolism, and elimination of Niraparib, an investigational poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase inhibitor, in cancer patients

> niraparib 의 PK를 밝혀냄.

BackgroundGo
Niraparib is an investigational oral, once daily, selective poly (adenosine diphosphate [ADP] ribose) polymerase (PARP)-1 and PARP-2 inhibitor. In the pivotal phase 3 ENGOT-OV16/NOVA study, niraparib met its primary endpoint of improving progression-free survival (PFS) in adult patients with recurrent ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer who achieved complete or partial response to platinum-based chemotherapy. Significant improvements in PFS were seen in all patient cohorts regardless of biomarker status (i.e., germline BRCA mutation and homologous recombination deficiency). Here, we present the absorption, metabolism, and elimination of niraparib, assessed in a dedicated clinical study (PR-30-5015-C).

Methods
Both cold and 14C-labeled niraparib were used to first determine its oral bioavailability, followed by evaluating its metabolic profile and mass balance (6 patients/study). High performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC/MS/MS) and radioactive detection methods were used to quantify niraparib and its major metabolites. LC/MS/MS and LC-high resolution MS were used to elucidate the structure of metabolites.

ResultsGo
Niraparib was rapidly absorbed and highly bioavailable (73%) in humans. Metabolism of niraparib was primarily hepatic via carboxylesterase-catalyzed amide hydrolysis, leading to the formation of an inactive acid metabolite (M1) which then underwent glucuronidation. Cytochrome P450 enzymes play a negligible role in niraparib metabolism in humans. Niraparib exhibited a long terminal half-life (~2 days), consistent with a once-daily dose regimen. Compound-related material, excreted comparably via renal and fecal routes, was well recovered (86%), suggesting minimal long-term body retention.

ConclusionsGo
The high bioavailability and long terminal half-life of niraparib may explain in part its anticancer activity and efficacy in treating ovarian cancer in the ENGOT-OV16/NOVA trial.

BackgroundGo
Elobixibat is a novel oral inhibitor of the ileal bile acid transporter and is currently under development for the treatment of chronic constipation. We performed a Phase I study to evaluate the safety, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics of elobixibat in Japanese patients with chronic constipation.

MethodsGo
The study consisted of 2 parts. In part 1, a single dose of elobixibat (2.5, 5, 10, 15 or 20 mg) or placebo was administered to 60 patients (10 received placebo) in a randomized double blind design. In part 2, elobixibat was administered to 60 patients for 2 weeks in the same manner as in part 1. The main purpose of part 1 was safety and pharmacokinetics, while the main objective of part 2 was the pharmacodynamic effect of elobixibat. Plasma cholest-4-en-7α-ol-3-one (C4), a biomarker reflecting bile acid synthesis, and the number of stool passages were measured as pharmacodynamic parameters.

ResultsGo
Elobixibat displayed linear pharmacokinetics with very low systemic exposure. When compared to fasting conditions, the plasma exposure of elobixibat decreased to 20-30% with breakfast. After repeated administration, plasma concentrations reached steady state after 7 days and no accumulation was found up to the dose of 15 mg. Plasma levels of C4 increased in response to each dose level, however the increase was blunted at 20 mg. LDL cholesterol levels were decreased from the dose of 5 mg onwards. Constipation was improved in a dose dependent manner. The change in the number of spontaneous bowel movements and C4 levels correlated well when the data were pooled from all dose groups. Elobixibat was well-tolerated except for mild gastrointestinal symptoms.

ConclusionsGo
Elobixibat showed a dose dependent effect in patients with chronic constipation and was well-tolerated. The effect on bowel movements correlated well with increased plasma C4 levels, a marker of its pharmacological action.

# 총평

> 이번 학회는 16번째로 열리는 IASP (International Association for the Study of Pain)의 meeting으로 전 세계에서 통증 전문가들이 모여 통증에 대한 전반적인 주제를 다루었다. 5일간 진행된 학회에서는 1,700개 이상의 포스터가 소개되었으며 다양한 주제에 대한 통증 전문가들의 강의가 진행되었다. 하루에 20개 남짓의 강의가 이루어졌지만 동시간에 진행이 되었기 때문에 하루에 약 2개 정도의 workshop에 참여할 수 있는 구조였다. 그 외 plenary session도 매일 오전, 오후 각 1번씩 참가할 수 있었다.

> 여러 강연에서 다양한 동물 모델을 이용하여 통증을 재현하고 연구하는 실험에 대한 소개가 많았다는 점이 인상적이었다. 또한 포스터 세션 동안에는 세계 각국에서 온 발표자들과 아주 가까운 거리에서 궁금한 점에 대해 토의를 할 수 있었다. 통증에 관한 연구가 무척 다양한 방면에서 이루어지고 있다는 점이 놀라웠으며 통증을 하나의 감각 자극으로만 받아들이던 과거에 비해 통증을 개개인 마다 가지는 유일무이한 경험으로 정의하며 총체적인 실체로서의 통증에 대한 이해를 가지고자 하는 것이 통증 관련 연구의 큰 흐름임을 느낄 수 있었다. 그러나 방대한 연구양에 비해 임상적으로 효율적인 통증 조절법 개발은 요원함을 느끼기도 한 자리였다. 한편 2년 후로 계획되어 있는 17번째 WCP가 벌써부터 기대가 되기 시작하였다.


젊은 임상약리학자들 간의 소통과 교류가 활성화되길 바라며 모든 참가자에게 2018년 말까지 EACPT 멤버십을 발행하였다.
