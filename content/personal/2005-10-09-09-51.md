Nothing in all creation presides over God's reign!

However, I saw the enchanting landscape of nature, creation out of description.
Having grave curiosity, I went to Eastbourne alone. 
No sooner I departed at Victoria Station than some friends arrived at Eastbourne to visit "Seven Sisters", the relentless and magnificent capes in sessex.
The route to "Seven sisters" seriously infatuated me.
"Oh..God....it's so beautiful...."
Far more surprisingly, we are totally enthralled by the zenith of Seven sisters.

All creation have to be silent in front of the Creator of this world.
Nobody can challenge the authority of Christ, who reign this world as the King after seeing such enormous scenary.
