On the way home, I just think of whether initial (and seething) fervour of the conversion is the natural reaction or just excessive feeling.
Because at the moment my ardour is too subsided-like fallible love of couples, there's still confusion about the relation between feeling and faith.

Feeling(despite the most vulnerable sense of our physical body) is sometimes greatly noticable and distinguishable both for others and for myself, but the problem is that feeling does not always support not only my will but God's will as well.

What I hope to be is less than a feeling-driven person through well-thought-of and self-righteous conduct, but rather a faith-driven person through well-founded and God-centered thought regardless of my feeling. Is that too exacting for me to bring to fruition?..

Yes, unless I'm with the Spirit.
