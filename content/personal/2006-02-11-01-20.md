Eventually Mr.Ryu became the Cabinet minister for health and welfare. It's somewhat surprising news for me.

Not sure whether this decision of the president (and the people of ROK) is right or wrong.
The decendants (or we) will make a final judgement on this later on.

There're seething pros and cons towards the designation of Mr.Ryu 
but one thing for sure, "Korea is shifting - rapidly even allowing the radical-left and ex-convict to be designated on the Cabinet minister"
