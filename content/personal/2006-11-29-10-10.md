But you are a chosen people, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, a people belonging to God, that you may declare the praises of him who called you out of darkness into his wonderful light.

True identity is not written on a brain. It's not from the internal self, but from the Words. This is the thing God called "a chosen people, a royal priesthood". How gloriously it says!

If we truly accept this truth, there should be no reason to be worried about this appearing hardship or burden in mind.. I know seeming facts cannot intimidate us.
