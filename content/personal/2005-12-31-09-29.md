Let no man despise thy youth; but be thou an example of the believers, in word, in conversation, in charity, in spirit, in faith, in purity. (1 Timothy 4:12)

An unassailable person- which means the stronger person based on the rooted faith and backing professionality
I want to be like that.

He corroborate my righteousness so that I will let no man despise my youth as if apostle Paul has said in 1 Timothy through the Bible.

The exam was ended but I, nonetheless, have an obligation for the sake of eradiation of my indolence still.
