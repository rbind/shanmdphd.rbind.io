3rd Year Maths & Computer Sciences, Trinity College

For the first 19 years of my life I had been an agnostic simply because I had always felt that the question of God's existence did not particularly matter, and even if he did exist, then it didn't matter. We had an agreement, I left him alone and He would leave me alone. Except as I was about to find out, He wouldn't.

After the first year at Oxford, my self esteem and pride had been knocked by persistent academic failing, and I felt worthless and depressed. Thinking I had nothing to lose, I prayed to God for the first time in my life, asking Him for help. Despite all my years of rejecting Him, he came through for me. Now, I have found inner peace from knowing that despite my flaws, my failings and my sins, there is someone whose love for me is all encompassing and unconditional. He loves us so much that he sent us his only son to die for us, just so we could attain everlasting life. There are still tough times, but God always help me through them. All I have to do is ask.
