Black ice means a wafer-thin, transparent layer of ice on an asphalted road(blacktop)  
that is hard to be discriminated from the road.
The black ice is much dangerous and threatening because it is very slippy.

Sometimes this invisible and thin existence jeoperdises me, not the obvious and tremendous.
Black-ice-like something.

PS:Probably atmosphere of Korea is chaotic and confusing because of the candal of Dr.Hwang and the unforeseen suicide of Ms.Lee.
I spent about two hours scrutinising the pertinent issues around them.
We are now watching the manifest falls of Korean national heroes.
