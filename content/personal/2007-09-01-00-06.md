모든 잘못된 것은 바로잡힐 것이다.
9월이여- 오라!

Her bones will ache
Her mouth will shake
And as the passion dies
Her magic heart will break
She'll fly to France
'Cause there's no chance
No hope for Cinderella
Come September
Her violet sky
Will need to cry
'Cause if it doesn't rain
Then everything will die
She needs to heal
She needs to feel
Something more than tender
Come September

Everything wrong
Gonna be all right
Come September

The souls that burn
Will twist and turn and
Find you in the dark
No matter where you run
But lost her spark
And what she's pushing for
She can't remember

Everything wrong
Gonna be all right
Come September

Her eyes surrender
Her cry a crying shame
Coming undone
Is she ever gonna
Feel the same
She will run
She's gona drink the sun
Shining just for you
Instead of everyone
And so it goes
She'll stand alone
And try no to remember
Come September

Everything wrong
Gonna be all right
Come September
She's made her mark
