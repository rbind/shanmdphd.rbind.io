New Student Pastor Appointed

We are pleased to announce that Tim Martin has been appointed as our new full-time student pastor. Tim will be joining us at the end of January as our full-time student pastor.  Originally from Canterbury, he has spent the last two-and-a-half years in central London working for the management consultancy company Accenture, studying part-time at London School of Theology and serving in the international student ministry at All Souls Church.  Before this, he was involved in campus evangelism during his time studying Management Science at the University of Warwick .  Tim has also spent a year working for a church in South Africa .

Tim will need accommodation. If you have ideas, please let Paul or Stephen know. Please be praying for Tim as he prepares to join us.


I'm very pleased to hear that.
I think the student ministry of the Christ Church will be much encouraged due to appointment of Tim. Paul- Now you can have more free time to relax!
