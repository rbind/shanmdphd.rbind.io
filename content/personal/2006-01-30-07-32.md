"In Christianity, pride (or vanity) is the essentially competitive and excessive belief in one's own abilities that interferes with the individual's recognition of the grace of God, or the worth which God sees in others. It has been called the sin from which all others arise. Pride is listed as one of the seven deadly sins, as superbia. Pride is also condemned in Hinduism. Ravana, an evil king who was killed by Rama, avatar of Vishnu, exhibited deadly sins of pride and lust. In spirituality pride is linked to the local "I" and ego, as distinct from the nonlocal "us"."
(From Wiki)

"Pride goes before destruction, a haughty spirit before a fall." (Proverbs 16:18)

"This is what they will get in return for their pride, for insulting and mocking the people of the LORD Almighty." (Zephaniah 2:10)

It is very great pleasure for us to hear acclamation or compliment in response of our particular serving or (self-denial) behavior. But there's a big danger. So often we became inflated on our feeling as we achieved the great something through our own effort or endeavour. Even when we may show humility as a reply of such compliment, sometimes our deep desire towards pride doesn't seem to be subsided because of seeming affectation of humility.

As C.S.Lewis said, "Perfect humility dispenses with modesty."
