Array

The more I studied English, the clearer I haven't knew English.
A weak human being is steadily recognising how foolish he was.
Be humble in presense of the King of knowledge, truth, and ways, Jesus Christ...

God, please help me from my complete ignorance of language.
I was so embarrased by that.
