Well, one to one study with James is goin' fine.
We've found out that the most important thing in our daily faith is to keep in mind what He've said to us and what He've wanted us to be.
Our desire and our nature shuold be obeidient and ready to listen because all scripture is all God-breathed.

While Human-being's brain is sometimes forgetful unless we give an effort to refresh what we wish to take, I also note that it is also a amazingly discerning part of our organs which performs a crucial role to record and fetch what we're thinking as important.
I'd like to take His words most for that.
