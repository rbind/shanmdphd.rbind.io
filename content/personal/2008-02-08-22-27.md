I just came back and am experiencing extremely chilly weather than I've felt before going.
It was fantastic value to meet many colleagues having the similar interest and scientific mind from the globe.
The most striking word I've heard was Peter's, a professor of molecular biology in Polland, who has been travelling all over the world.

"Keep going, and science gives you freedom although it won't give you money"

I thought as far as I'll be able to afford myself and the future family it doesn't really matter whether my vocation will give me a fortune or not in that I am already feeling a sense of liberty and the rigorous motivation towards science.

This symposium still tells me a lot. "Keep going and be given precious freedom."
