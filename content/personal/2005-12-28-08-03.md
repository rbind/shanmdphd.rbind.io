Array

The end of the long-term striving and endeaver consuming numerous time is near for me.
The nearer the aim is coming, the more aspiration is gotten.
Actually, however, a cul-de-sac enables us to frustrate us quite often, but it is less than a heighted wall we never overcome.

How can it mar us who are always led by Holy Spirit?
