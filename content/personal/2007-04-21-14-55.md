Recently Soogee started to work for HK airways, which is not very big but has a long history.(since 1947) I'm quite happy to hear she got chosen and proud of her pursuit for an appropriate position where she can stand firmly.

I'm certain that she must be a good flight attendent after taking training in the hub(probably Hongkong international airport? which makes me remind the last leisure time of January by only mentioning the place) since she's been hardworking.
