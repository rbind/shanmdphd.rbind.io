Never give in--
Never, never, never, never, in nothing great or small, large or petty, 
never give in except to convictions of honor and good sense. 
Never yield to force; 
Never yield to the apparently overwhelming might of the enemy. 

Do not let us speak of darker days: let us speak rather of sterner days. These are not dark days; these are great days - the greatest days our country has ever lived; and we must all thank God that we have been allowed, each of us according to our stations, to play a part in making these days memorable in the history of our race.



Winston Churchill

낙심하지 말고 더 좋은 것을 주실 것을 믿음으로 하나님의 뜻을 계속 구하자~ 기도 할께!
