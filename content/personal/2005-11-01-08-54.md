" Let me think of enthusiasm You have given.
Everytime of recent days, I am deeply grateful for giving me Your whole grace.
Have I had such zeal and effort to self-modification before I met you? "

Changing myself is not quite easy.
Human beings tend to have deep mannerism when they don't need to worry about
hunger, danger, persecution, burden, or hardship.
