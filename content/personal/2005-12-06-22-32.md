There're so many people who need our help.
Everyone speaks out the earth is dying by starvation, hunger, danger and pollution.
However, just few people behave on behalf of solution for those adversities and hardship.

I truly repent.
I only had narrow sight for viewing within my eyescope.

Pretension is the biggest curtain that masks our desperate mind.
We have affected like acute manner and well-wrapped behavior are internalised, but please undercover our pretension.
And just concede that we need tremendous helping for escaping our hypocrisy and resolving these hopeless circumstance of the earth.

We need action- Uncover our pretension.
