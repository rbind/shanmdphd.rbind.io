I'm so secured because God always gives me lots of friends who are taking the same ship of faith.
Because they repetedly encouraged me to have confidence in mind and prayed for each member of the group continually, our relationship is getting reinforced and I cannot help giving thanks to God. 

Everything on earth has a purpose and I really hope you to know it.
It's really important and unavoidable in each life and it doesn't give you a fall, I bet.
If you don't know who Jesus is and what He've done for you, please please.

Know God and know your life.

나는 의로운 중에 주의 얼굴을 보리니 깰 때에 주의 형상으로 만족하리이다 시편 17:15
