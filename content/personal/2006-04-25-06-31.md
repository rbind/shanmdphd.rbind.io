Over every though,
Over every word,
May my life reflect the beauty of my Lord;

This verse is true. What I need is not just a thought or word, but a life reflecting the greatness and reign of the Lord.

I've heard many times that 'you always say, but not act' What a shame! This is the most serious indication of what Christian can be pointed out.

Thus I need his grace which will inherit broad change of my life in accordance with His words.

This is 'my only one request'.
'Won't You reign in me again?'

Lord Reign In Me - Jami Smith  (vertical music)

Over all the earth You reign on high
Every mountain stream every sunset sky
But my one request Lord my only aim
Is that You’d reign in me again

Lord reign in me
Reign in Your power
Over all my dreams
In my darkest hour
You are the Lord of all I am
So won’t You reign in me again

Over every thought over every word
May my life reflect the beauty of my Lord
You mean more to me than any earthly thing
So won’t You reign in me again
