Shirking duty has to do with our sinful nature.
Improper marriage between duties and laziness ultimately result in failure in objectives.

In general, indolence tends to be internalised to me whenever I'm in being absent from the Scripture.
I cannot help ascribing lethargy to my sinful nature of body.
What I struggle towards is not the others, but me - for better of worse.

Fear God and and keep his commandments, for this is the whole duty of man. - Ecclesiastes 12:14
