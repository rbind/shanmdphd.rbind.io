To follow the pattern of this study is surely boring. And I know it'll contain hosts of hardship and unease but I accepted to follow and I chose to be holy, even though the way does not guarantee the wealth, authority, power and comfort by any means. Because the Lord Almighty have become my rock and comforter, I do not need them.

'Now therefore, if ye will obey my voice indeed, and keep my covenant, then ye shall be a peculiar treasure unto me above all people: for all the earth is mine: And ye shall be unto me a kingdom of priests, and an holy nation. These are the words which thou shalt speak unto the children of Israel.'

The holy covenent is given to me already. I don't need anything except being a peculiar treasure unto him as the royal member of an holy nation. There is only reaction for the salvation, isn't it?
