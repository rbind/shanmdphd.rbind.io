Eventually we've got widing up of all the courses in Royal Holloway. The time was sometimes so stressful but it would be such a good memory for me.

The past day gives us a lot of memories and nostalgia out of our emotion and mind. Sometimes the idea that the present time is so nice to everyone seldom came up. It's so weird.

Anyway this week was fairly stressful because I've finished FOUR cumbersome projects which are largely based on external materials not handled in the lectures. So happy- no obligation exists but there's also no termination for kicking off new works.

Yeah
