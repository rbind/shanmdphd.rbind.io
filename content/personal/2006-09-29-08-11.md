These are recent photos of beautiful people of Christ Church in UK, those who follow J.C. Their lovely smile reminds me truly awesome memories that make me also smile enough to forget the present worries and concerns. Altough eeming hardships may intimidate us, we are the genuine God's people. 

Ah, so happy to see them and hear them.

 
Lovely people in Kris & John's.
