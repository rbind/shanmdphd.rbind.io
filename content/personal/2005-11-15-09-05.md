Array

Today I saw the ΙΧΘΥΣ (Iota Chi Theta Upsilon Sigma).
It is an acronym which is made up "JESUS CHRIST, SON OF GOD, SAVIOR"
<>< is seen as a digited symbol.
Because ΙΧΘΥΣ refers to fish in English, we use <><, looked like fish.
As well, since Jesus called Peter as the fisher of men,
we have used Ichthys symbolically.

It is believed that societies of Christians in the early Roman Empire, 
protected their congregations by keeping their meetings secret.
And symbolisation of <>< is one of the most ancient and widespread encipherment, I think.

How wise they were!
