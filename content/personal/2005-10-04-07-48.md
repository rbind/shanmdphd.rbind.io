"When pride comes, then comes disgrace, but with humility comes wisdom." (Proverbs 11:2)

Did I have pride in my mind?
Yes, I did.
Therefore, disgrace was followed gradually.
Every circumstance that I belong is wholly granted by the Lord, but I regarded it as my own property.
This fault, arrogance, is repetitious weakness to attain to the whole measure of the fullness of Christ. 
How should I throw it away?
I have to be strong and bold in Jesus
