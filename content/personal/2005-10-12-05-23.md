There is only incessant studying in my life.
I, human being, should study more and glorify and materialize the kingdom of God, which was given to me since I gradually knew Christ.

Everyday, Every time,
I have to study and behave.

Although hardship and burden would surround me as a whole,
Whenever I would feel joyful and sad,
Wherever I would be.

"Study to shew thyself approved unto God, a workman that needeth not to be ashamed, rightly dividing the word of truth." 2 Timothy 2:15
