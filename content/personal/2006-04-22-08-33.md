Array

Why have I not recognised the fact that there's much similarity between the flag of England and the cover of the book, 'Love, Actually' (the gospel of John) which is issued by Oxford Christian Union?

Eventually I've known that since I saw them in the same place- in my bag.
Gosh!
What does the cover mean? Presumably, it means entire evangelisation of England by the gospel.

What geniuses they are!
