Written expression on paper often contains far more significance than merely digitalised signals. Surely we are all longing for a human touch and communication through a pen and paper.
Getting a hand-writing mail is precious in that
1. it gives us expectation for tearing the envelope.
2. it gives us a smile during thinking upon the person who sent a mail.
3. it enables us to feel close especially when we are abroad.
4. it encourages us to call them a day or some days later so that we can connect one another more.
Yes, these are very simple ideas that even a kid also knows but sometimes simplity implies simple happiness.

Today I was given some letters unexpectedly. They made me so delight and happy. Obviously there is a deep pit that cannot be topped up via e-mail!
