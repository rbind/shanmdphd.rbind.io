Light of the world you stepped down into darkness. This is what every creature desires to see but the fact was that Light of the world extinguished by our sinful nature seemed to easily disappear. 

Most circumstances at the moment around us entangled ourselves in great debt of God, nevertheless the light was less than as weak as darkness.

Light enlightens every obscurity by its own speed and luminosity so that we can have and see a hope based on that radiance.
