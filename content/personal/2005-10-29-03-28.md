I unexpectedly became a member of student-staff commitee, 
as a sophomore undergraduate prepresentative.

According to Prof.Song,
"I'm sure that all people would be a representative of the certain community someday,
and they have to thoroughly prepare and train the time of being a leader
if they are expecially Christians who have a responsibility 
as salt preventing from corruption. 
The leader will be evaluated by what he has done and performed 
regardless of his personality and faith.
The time would come without consciousness. Remember this."

Exactly. The time came.
But I'm not prepared- How terrible!
I have to pray for knowledge and wisdom.
