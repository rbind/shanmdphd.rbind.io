Missing the past

People often missed the past and wanted the former times back.
Because the past largely contains copious events, incidents, episode, occurrence and memory,
it seems that intrinsic characteristic of human being is to recollect the good old days.
However, missing the past sometimes obstruct betterment and progress..

It never returns. Let's forget it and make every effort for the fullness of Him.
