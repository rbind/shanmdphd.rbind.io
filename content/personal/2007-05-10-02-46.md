It's more difficult and demanding than I've ever thought but I'm so pleased that only God can make me have confidence to cope with these things. Not because I'm smart or intelligent but because He knows why I should be here for now, I may be truly pleased and happy. There were hundreds of hardship and burden in mind after January, nevertheless I've done so well due to His guidance and care.

God, I know, is so good and merciful. I adore You, the Lord..

Cheer up, Pil!
