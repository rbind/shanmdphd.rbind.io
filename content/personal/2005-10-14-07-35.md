It takes surprisingly lots of time for internalizing new habits of good deeds.
With a strong and firm will, I would change my inclination and propensity towards bad things.

1. Putting off works which I sould do,
2. Late sleeping due to plausible reasons,
3. Seeming favor based on my own interest

How could I get rid of them?
Oh, the poor guy-

But changing habits is so worthy that I can't ignore it anymore.
It should be happen from NOW, not tommorow, not after a while.
