"I want to get a good night's sleep. This is not what I wanted. I don't want to be associated with an organisation getting headlines like this,"
This is the saying of Founder of Fathers 4 justice, Matt O'Connor at Channel 4 News.

Fathers 4 Justice is a worldwide campaigning group with branches in the Netherlands, the USA, Canada, Australia, Italy and Sweden campaigning for equal parenting, family law reform and fathers' rights. 
The United Kingdom branch announced that it was to be disbanded in January 2006, following negative publicity surrounding a plot to kidnap the son of the then Prime Minister, Tony Blair. (this paragraph is from Wikipedia)
