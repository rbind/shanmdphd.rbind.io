Standing tall in this wide space,
Getting lost in your embrace.
I see a fire burning brigh - ter;
It's calling me to catch the flame.
내가 이 황량한 곳에 홀로 서있을때,
당신 품에서 길을 잃은 것 같을 때,
타오르는 밝은 불을 보네
그것은 내가 불길을 잡도록 부르고 있네

He is the consuming fire. By the flame of His righteous love, He leads us onward toward the goal - which is glorious and victorious. And one day, we - His pure, spotless and radiant bride - will live with Him in His heavenly palace forever.

Until then, I'll feel like I'm falling in love with Him. Definitely, not just a feeling- but with confidence.

I feel like i'm falling over and o-ver in love with you.
It's not just a feeling, but i know that he is real.
I feel like i'm falling into the arms of a mighty God.
It's not just a feeling, but i know that he is real.
