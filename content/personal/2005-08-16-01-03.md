I am supposed to serve as a best man in Sungbae's marrige on this Saturday.
Today, the rehearsal was performed in Grace Chapel with some relevant people.
When I standed at the front of quite a few chairs, the bride entered happily with her father.
All participants who watched the marrying scene had to rise up, applauding toward the two people warmly.

"Let us be glad and rejoice, and give honour to him: for the marriage of the Lamb is come, and his wife hath made herself ready.
우리가 즐거워하고 크게 기뻐하며 그에게 영광을 돌리세 어린 양의 혼인 기약이 이르렀고 그의 아내가 자신을 준비하였으므로"
Revealation 19:7

Thus, I, the bride of Christ, will keep my body and soul as clean as possible for the glory of God's feast, as I felt in the place of marrige rehearsal today.
