Array

My loving country- Korea. I pray for my homeland.
There is a great gulf among Koreans, from which enormous chaos is resulted. I pray for the scientist society and the citizens of korea so that they would wisely cope with crisis and resolve the splitted chasm. 

May you grant unity for us. 
I believe that only You are able to narrow the gap down.
