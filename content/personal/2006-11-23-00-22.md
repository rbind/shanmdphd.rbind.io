(Not because Korean language is inferior to the others, but because Korean is not quite popular in the world. For this reason, I chose to be more commited to using more English in a blog. I also know many Koreans have an excellent verbal ability(unbelievable 100% literacy) and I believe you're certainly able to understand what I'm blogging!)

Awesome God.

He relieved the present tense feeling and controled my thought of being negative!

I spoke of the titles of thanksgiving in the morning, this speaking indeed made me confident in planning for the next few days.

That's right. Coming weekdays must be tough, yet full of grace and strength which inflate and renew me!

Thanks be to God always, all the time!
