Washington said in its annual rights report that China was one of the world's "most systematic" offenders. In return Beijing urged the US to "look squarely" at its own problems, such as a high murder rate and jail population. [BBC news 9 Mar 2006]

I'm sure we can make better our world not by politicians' verbose speech, but by tacit action.
