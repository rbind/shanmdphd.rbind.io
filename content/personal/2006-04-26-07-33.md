"Thanks be to God" (2 Corinthians 9:15)

We say like this just after the Bible reading during the Sunday service. It's particularly impressive for me because the congregations of Korea rarely say the sentence, and instead, we say 'Amen'.



But the fact that everything is coming from His grace would make us always thank him, not just after the formal Bible reading. 

I especially appreciated God today because of his continual offers and cares through people around me. They sometimes could be not weighed that much but I've suddenly noticed that I should have thanked to God due to them. Not everyone knows it but we, Christians should be utterly sensitive to His caring and offering so that we may always remind the graceful sentence "Thanks be to God" in every second.
