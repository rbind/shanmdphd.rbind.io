At the half past year of 2007.

I should've done more attempts to know Him and contemplate His words but I usually shirked what He wants me to do and think, and instead I mainly focused what I would like to do, simply saying 'my want must be the same as what He wants.'

I cannot forget how He has treated me and how He has led me.

Of course there's no drastic change between the halves of an year, but I should change my attitude of life at this time. Give thanks to the Lord for letting me know what the Spirit hopes me to know!
