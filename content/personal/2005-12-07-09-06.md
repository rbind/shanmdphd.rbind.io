Array

When it comes to winter, this season really contains numorous events.
Can you remember times of the quiet-room in Seohyun St.?
Pah-

Sometimes those memories are bitter-sweet.
It not only stimulates my heart of hapiness, but goads dim recollections of mistakes.

Surely it snowed slightly.
Eventually you asked me the question.
'why?'
I answered the question. It echoed in air but I cannot remember. 
It's just old memory-

All right. Anyhow I'll go there, I promise.
