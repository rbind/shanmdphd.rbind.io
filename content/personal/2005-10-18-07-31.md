I am at the bottom of self-esteem.
As I stand in presence of God with honesty,
seeming pride and weakness ware apparently revealed.

How dare I devoted to God with such turpitude!
When the Light of truth has uncovered my existence once again since I came here, I gradually realised how I pursue God's knowledge and how I achieve the purification of my heart.

--------------------
Do you still think that you could accomplish the great work without the purification of your heart and removal of the plank in your eyes?

Please, let us be humble..
