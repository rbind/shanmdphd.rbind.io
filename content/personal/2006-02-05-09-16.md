I started the period of the military service exact 4 years ago.
Whenever I have a reflection of that time,
it makes me smile and glimpse because the period had a complex meaning for me.

I remember one writing on the desk of the training classroom which renewed my mind-
It was
"The thing that cannot make me die merely strengthens me.
I cannot make give-up happen to me."

Truly.
