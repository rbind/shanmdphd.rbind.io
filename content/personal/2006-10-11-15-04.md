UN sanction is about to happen but I'm doubtful how it will work and bring peace to these countries. I acknowledge that this sanction is inevitable but we-US, South Korea, and North Korea- absolutely need to discuss this seriously mad situation with understanding one another's circumstance and position for now. 

Nuclear weapons should be prohibited on earth and it cannot be used by the strong country either. Using of the nuclear weapon is the very last thing Homo Sapiens can use and it can be justified by no means. I'm very sad in the fact that brothers hate brothers, and brothers target brothers.

It's the worst thing that the humanbeings conceive and cannot be parallel with the idea of God.
