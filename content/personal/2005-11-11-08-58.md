My wickedness.

Deluge, the overwhelming flood, of lewdness has suddenly and usually visited
my mind and stirred it up violently..
I should've trust the triumph of grace, but how weak and frail the human being's will-!

When I look into my heart, and take my wickedness,
I often confront myself acting as sanctimounious and pretentious sluggard.
How terrible..
How awful..

While I was in lack of faith, another wicked crimes were happened on the opposite side of the world- Are they irrelevant each other or not?
I'm so sad.



I confess You my total depravity.
You know me more than me and You know the aftermath of my behaviour-!
Please let me focus on grace and let me be convinced that the triumph of grace is predestined by Your blood.
