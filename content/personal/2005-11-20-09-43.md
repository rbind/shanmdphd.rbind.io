Array

Did you focus lights 
on a point of a paper 
through a convex lens?
You might do..

Father in Heaven did like that two thousand years ago.

He focused all people's sin from the beginning of the world to the end of the world
on Christ that we belong to 
through the Cross.

Here is the grace of God I stand.
