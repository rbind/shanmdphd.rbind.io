One thing that I am really feeling about is that great purpose-driven person never fails. 

Yes, I know- there're lots of seeming fails and downfalls but what I mean is that a chance will be given to those who seek and pursue the great thing.

Fails and downfalls cannot ever make me down.

고교졸업앨범 속의 한 문장을 기억하며.
Boys
be
ambitious.

"어두운 암흑 속을 질주하는 소년들이여
방향을 잃어버린 그 핸들을 부셔버려라
네 손에 쥐어진 좌절의 술잔을 깨어 부셔라
너의 현실을 직시하여라"
