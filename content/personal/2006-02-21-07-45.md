Holocaust deniers are people who contend that the Holocaust - the attempt by Nazi Germany to annihilate European Jewry during World War Two - never happened. According to the deniers, the Nazis did not murder six million Jews, the notion of homicidal gas chambers is a myth, and any deaths of Jews that did occur under the Nazis were the result of wartime privations, not of systematic persecution and state-organised mass murder.

What a horrible!
We are living in the world even obvious truth could be denied. Should we tolerate apprently wicked assertion like the Holocaust deniers or pro-Japanese groups?
I'm not a bigot who speaks only probity but I'm so certain that we should fight against the distortion of history with history itself and with truth.
