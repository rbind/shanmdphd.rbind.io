Array



Just a perfect day
Drink sangria in the park
And then later
When it gets dark
We go home

Just a perfect day
Feed animals in the zoo
Then later, a movie, too
And then home

CHORUS
  Oh it's such a perfect day
  I'm glad I spent it with you
  Oh! such a perfect day
  You just keep me hanging on
  You just keep me hanging on

Just a perfect day
Problems all left alone
Weekenders on our own
It's such fun

Just a perfect day
You made me forget myself
I thought I was someone else
Someone good

CHORUS

You're going to reap just what you sow (x4)

Oh! What a perfect day

Remember this: Whoever sows sparingly will also reap sparingly, and whoever sows generously will also reap generously. - 2 Corinthian 9:6
