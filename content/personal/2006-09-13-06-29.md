I've been thinking of 'Holy Sweat', the concept that Kent Hughes mentioned in the discipline of Godly Man. It's a very interesting word because sweat itself doesn't include any meaning of holyness. It's all about our heart and motive to sweat.

Am I pursuing what deserves sweat?
Seriously the answer should be reasonable and ready.
