We are hard pressed on every side yet not crushed; We are perplexed but not in despair; Persecuted but not forsaken; struck down but not destroyed; For we who live are always delivered to death for Jesus sake; Therefore we do not lost heart, for our light afflictions which is but for a moment, is working for us a far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory. (2 Corinthians 4:8-13;14-17 NKJV)

Here are great ironies in these verses. Irony of life style and circumstance as Christians sometimes suggests hosts of wisdom for us- because we can ponder again the paradoxical aspecs of life in the way that leads us to separated extremes and converges one thought between those.
