Controversial plans to introduce ID cards have passed the Commons. There is large devide between pros and cons here.

The most impressive point is the attitude of Tony Blair.
He spoke "Instead of wasting hundreds of millions of pounds on compulsory ID cards as the Tory Right demand, let that money provide thousands more police officers on the beat in our local communities" in a passionate speech against Identity Cards to the 1995 Labour party conference in Brighton.

Contrarilry, 10 years later he not only wants an ID card himself, but wants the British scanned, fingerprinted and registerd on the largest biometric database. (Even the government of Korea have not executed the compulsary collects of the iris scan since it had initiated the civilian registraion!)

Is this change indicating a property of authority?
He was not a premier in 1995, but entirely rebelled the previous opinion after he became the most influential man of UK.

I didn't fully understand the Identity Card Bill which cleared the house of Commons yet, but it is certain that it would shows lots of properties and attributes of UK for me.
