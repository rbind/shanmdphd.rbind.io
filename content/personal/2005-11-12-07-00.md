1. 
When it was even 5 o'clock, the sun disappeared out of sight from the sky.

Sunset time was so early.
Few people were walking along the street.
Gusty winds were blowing through.
Moreover, slight shower added in the extraordinary atmosphere.
These were the sights of the evening.

2.
There is an saying that "Out of sight, out of mind".
What do you think?
Do you agree, disagree, or have no idea?
It's somewhat tricky because even though sight is not reliable sense,
it is largely reigning our mind.
I cannot easily decide the question.

If it's true, how about "Into sight, into mind?"
Rubbish, uh? But it's not simple hastly to decide-
