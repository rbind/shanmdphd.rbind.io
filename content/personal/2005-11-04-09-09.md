Eventually, the ultimate internet browser came for me!
Firefox is what I have looked for!
I truly recommend that it would be more beneficial using Firefox 
instead of Microsoft Internet Explorer.

0. Tabbed Browsing <- it's really useful! REALLY
1. Advanced Security System
2. Slim size (4.7MB)
3. Well-optimized for Unix
4. Perfect support for personalized font using
5. Faster, faster, faster, faster!

If it could do, I would erase Internet Explorer right now.
But, very Cyworld does not support the Firefox properly-
It's not good- not so good-

I'm surely certain that Firefox is the most convenient browser on the planet Earth.
