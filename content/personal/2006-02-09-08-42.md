Whatever you ask for in prayer, believe that you have received it, and it will be yours. (Mark)

When God's at the center of your life, you worship. When he's not, you worry. (Purpose Driven Life)

Many are the plans in a man's heart, but it is the Lord's purpose that prevails. (Proverbs)

Are they belonging to Christ?
NO! 
If so, I don't need to hesitate any more.

No doubt. The power of the Lord is not restricted within my thought and perception and have never been done like so.

There's no reason to delay my decision and the Lord will surely set me free through His grace and mercy.
