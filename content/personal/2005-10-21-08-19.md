Only One Life at All Soul Church

There was a ceremony for meeting Christian students in London-wide universities under the title of Only One Life.
Although I couldn't meet Nathan's fiance Liddy, it was great time for me because I more and better knew friends of Christian Union-Jon, Calvin, Ndidi, and David. It was so thankful that I was able to sing and worship with them regardless of differences in cultural background, language and race.

Jesus made us united.
Through Him, we shall/can love one another.
It was amazing gospel all over the world.
