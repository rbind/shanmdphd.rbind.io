There is a saying that "Curiosity killed a cat."
This means that needless curiosity of people ruined their life.

However,
The advertisement of Microsoft suggests that "Curiosity never killed a graduate."
This is a exemplary thought of students in here.

Although they don't know exactly,
they promptly speak out without thinking whether it would be true or false.
Honestly I am envious of their rashness toward curiosity.

So far recticence, the typical mind of Korean, worked well, but I'd better manage attitude from shyness to enthusiasm.

Remember, curiosity never killed me.
Not in England anyway.
