About a month rapidly went by and the time was precious enough.
I am deeply grateful for my family and every brother and sister, praying for me always.
Not had I meet them, I couldn't be accustomed to this unfamiliar circumstance.
They encourage me to be independent without blemish and with love and warm heart.

When I think upon last one month, all things were through grace and all process were under grace.
I hope to confidently confess in this time of grace that
"The years go by but You're unchanging.
In this fragile world, you are the only firm foundation."



The temperature decreases fastly.
