I've made 682 writings here on the diary section.(Now 683 writings) I'm so happy to review these postings and I've found truly hilarious things here. These made me smile and laugh.

People often forgot what they did one or few years ago, not because they are ignorant but because we're basically human-being whose memory is imperfect. The diary section makes me remind me the past events and is good in terms of this point.
