"According to your faith will it be done to you" Matthew 9:29

Regardless of circumstances entangled around, God's providence is endless and His love to us is perpetual.

We live by faith, and I truly hope to believe "according to faith will it be done".

Thanks be to God!

"I couldn't face my life tomorrow
Without Your hope in my heart I know"

Praises be to God!
