As Helen told me, I scribbled the thankful points of the day.
Surprisingly there're so many things to appreciate that I cannot help just praying.
We always quibble and procracinate all our expression towards Him, but with or without our conciousness He always pour unfailing grace and make us soar in the sky.
Unless we intentionally find out the thankful points, I think we might be unaware of the enormous love-Bomb from God certainly.
