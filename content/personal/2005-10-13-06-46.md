<The Lord's Covenant Promise to David>

I chose you to lead my people Israel when you were just a shepherd boy, tending your sheep out in the pasture.

Thanks God, but I'm sorry God. Although you chose me to lead your people when I was just a little boy, without knowing your unfailing love, I was stupid and ignoran, having needless cowardness and not being sincere. I could understand your covenent which would never be changed, never be modified. The great work you will make up was granted me, thus I want to take responsibility toward that throughly. Please God- Give me your strength and shelter. Your peace as well. Your peace will guard my hearts and minds as I live in Christ Jesus.

"Don't worry about anything; instead, pray about everything!" Philipians 4:6
