There was the 2nd Dept. of CS Committee today.
What I really suprised was that the Staff carefully provided detailed and comprehensive minutes
and the agenda of the meeting.
Moreover feedbacks of asking were quite good enough and desirable.
I think this systematic and standardised working process made this country 
to be advanced and well-ordered society.

In the discussion there were some requests that seemed to be unreasonable and headstrong.
Nevertheless the staffs kindly accepted them and said  'We will thoroughly consider and feed you back. We respect your 

thankful asking.'

Principles based on order and respect.
and attitudes that I should learn by heart.
