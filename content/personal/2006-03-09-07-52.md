There's been actually brinkmanship in my life in some sense but nowadays I'm feeling like true brinkmanship has been eventually materialised because of setting a new aim and purpose.
It seems to be absurd and awkward but I'm so serious and I'm confidently praying.

There's no perpetual existence in this fragile world-

If we truly accept this simple assumption, we cannot avoid our bold choice and can pave the way for the glorious improvement.

Thank you the Lord.

인생은 선택의 연속이고, 가끔 돌이킬 수 없을 만한 각오를 해야한다.
