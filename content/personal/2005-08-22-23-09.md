Pride goes before destruction, a haughty spirit before a fall. (Proverbs 16:18)

Lord informed that I have to abandon my implanted pride and haughtiness.
Admittedly, I have had myriad of self-confidence and pride in distorted mind 
which lead me to a hollow victory. 
I perceived the truth that destruction is silently coming through them.
I cannot do anything but being quiet in the sight of God today.

Lord, please apologize me.
May all of the pride and arrogance be rooted out of me!
