For this reason, Christ is the mediator of a new covenant, that those who are called may receive the promised eternal inheritance - now that he has died as a ransom to set them free from the sins committed under the first covenant. (Hebrews 9:15)

How many doubters are on earth!
Have we been certain about the fact that we are called and adopted as glorious children of the Lord, 
the truth would have set us free from affliction, grievance and condemnation because in His selection has been perpetually faithful and unchanging.

Humanbeings failed (and what made the matter worse, defied Him) and now need to be set free not by our endeaver or belief, but by mediator of a new covenant.
Such a great disparity time to time makes us more doubt ironically but based on Written promises, we've been able to approach the throne.

I cannot help just saying it's amazing.
