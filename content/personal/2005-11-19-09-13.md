Array

It was so chilly!
Even frost on the grass welcomed my going out.
However, for the purpose of guaranteeing my early wakeup 
I shall not screen my window with a curtain.
I cannot trust myself especially in the morning-

But you know what!?
Today I was very delighted and pleased-!!
HA HA 
briliant.
I'm so grateful for being alive.
