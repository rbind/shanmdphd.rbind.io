This posting is what I've thought in 40 day meeting based on the book 'Purpose Driven Life' by Mr. Warren.

--------------------

"He comforts us in all our troubles so that we can comfort others.
When others are troubled, we will be able to give them the same comfort God has given us."
2 Corinthians 1:4 (NLT)

What a great statement Paul said! Does every single person belonging to God aid those who have been troubled? Moreover, are such aids that we can offer exactly the same as what God has given us?

This is really awesome. Empathy and symphasy are really hard to be out of our worldly perspective.  It's all out of His perspective towards those who are in need because we might not have enough love to embrace the other's pain and soreness without internal peace and comfort. God do give us such love and comfort in light of our weakness, fragility, instability, and vulnerability.

I cannot help saying to myself "Sungpil, do your best to serve others as Jesus did. You can give the same comfort not because you are powerful enough but because He is powerful and abundant enough!"

GIVE THANKS
