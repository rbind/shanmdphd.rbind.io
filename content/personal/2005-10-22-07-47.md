Array

It's exactly right.

Goldworthy defines the kingdom as 'God's people in God's place under God's rule' in a nutshell. 
That may sound like an overly uncomplicated definition for such a significant theme in Scripture, but the simple words contain great depth.

How can we enter the kingdom of God?
Paul said, "I strain to reach the end of the race and receive the prize for which God, through Christ Jesus, is calling us up to heaven. -Philippians 3:14" 

It is solely by His grace and love that we were saved from sinful nature and authority of evil, but due to the joy and pleasure of such obvious fact, we shall strain to reach the end of the race.
Because the Lord is always faithful and sincere and the Kingdom of God is not realised yet, our eager and effort to the Lord are worthy enough to endure every malicious attack and to tolerate nasty humiliation.

In that point, without the covenant of Jesus,
I cannot live a day in the flood of turpitude like this.

Please God,
make me the beacon of obedience.
