"I can't hear you,
would you PLEASE speak up..?"

I've been seeking spiritual purity, however it sometimes makes me embarassed because such purity easily goes down in accordance with my daily change of feeling.
Then I've strived to find the other things rather than the Almighty.

Everyone on earth is hoping to rely on someone who deserve our dependence. 
(presumably often parents but not always- time to time lovers, superstars or machines)
Not hundred-percent sure but I've found that I'm also the one doing like that too many times.
