Array

A raiil travel gives me some inspiration of daily life and review of the past days.

People go to somewhere with somewhat expectation and people come back to daily routine.
This pattern has repeated day by day.

As the old days gone by fastly, 
I was in a train and recollected the memories of the past warm time...

Time, run by and that never shall come again.
