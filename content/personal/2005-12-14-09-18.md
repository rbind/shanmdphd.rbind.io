What do you think about the most necessary thing for human-beings when we would be in flood?
Ironically it is water, drinkable water fit to drink.

People are living in 'the flood of information', not normal flood but disasterous deluge, but we by no means have drinkable water. It's mostly rubbish and useless.

I still pant as a thirsty deer for water of life and for wisdom of spirit.
Surely so do we all.
