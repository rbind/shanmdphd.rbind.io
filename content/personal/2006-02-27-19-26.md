A British national daily newspaper is asking readers "what it means to be British." This one came from Switzerland...
"Being British is about driving in a German car to an Irish pub for a Belgian beer, then travelling home, grabbing an Indian curry or a Turkish kebab on the way, to sit on Swedish furniture and watch American shows on a Japanese TV and, the most British thing of all, suspicion of anything foreign!" - from "Connection" the parish magazine of Christ Church.
How witty-
