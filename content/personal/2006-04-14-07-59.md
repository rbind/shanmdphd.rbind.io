Balancing our life is what we're easily ignorant of especially when we're under a bunch of things to do. Ouf life is a long-run race, which we must keep in balance and steadiness regardless of our hectic circumstances. One guy who gives an emphasis only on his work (or study) tends to get easily tired and bored.

At that time, we tend to make an excuse like "It doesn't matter at this moment because this balance will get back and become perfect soon" But the fact is that there's no automatic reaction to stabilize our unbalance.

Now I should remember balancing outweighs superiority.
