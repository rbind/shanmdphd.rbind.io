A prayer,
the word that human being can humbly take when hardship or uncertainty comes into a reality

A response,
the godly works which is given by grace, whether it is benign or malign in our perspective

I've done my best until now after coming back to Korea, but still everything is foggy and vague. The only thing that I take for now is a prayer.. Humble prayer which submit myself to the sovereign will of His.

기도할 수 있어서 참 다행이다. 기도할 수 없어서 참 비참했다.
